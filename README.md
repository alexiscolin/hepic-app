# ðŸ¥‡ Hepic App

> Hepic app is made with â™¡ by de jaune et de bleu

App available on Netlify - https://hepic-app.netlify.com/

## Informations

This app is created by using [VueJS](https://vuejs.org/) in order to build user interfaces and makes a big use of VueJS dependencies library as [Vue-router](https://router.vuejs.org/) that controls every routing management or [VueX](https://vuex.vuejs.org/) that is a pattern for state management.

Furthermore, Hepic app is generated by [Webpack](https://webpack.js.org/) as asset pipeline. This bundle manager is a modified version of the one generated by [VueCli](https://cli.vuejs.org/). It was modified by [de jaune et de bleu](https:www.de-jaune-et-de-bleu.com) for Hepic company.
Webpack is setup to use [LESS](http://lesscss.org/) for CSS and [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) for JavaScript compiling/transpiling and [Pug - Jade](https://pugjs.org/api/getting-started.html) for templating generation.

## Assets management

### Src > assets folder

This folder is the basic one that you should use by default for your assets. Webpack process all assets in order to improve app performance:

* small images are converted to data URL in base64 to  avoid extra network requests.
* result filenames include hashes, in this way we will have the same URL as long as the content is the same. So you donâ€™t need to worry about browser caching their old versions.

### Root folder

All assets localised in `root` folder will be copied at the root of the `dist` folder. It's a usefull system to manage asset that are required for environement and should avoid be processed by Webpack. It's a modification from VueCLi boilerplate. Hepic may use it for Netlify redir as exemple.

### Static folder

Static folder manage all asset that will not be processed by Webpack and require an absolute URL: useful for these situations:

* You need a file with a specific name in the build output.
* You have thousands of images and need to dynamically reference their paths.
* Some library may be incompatible with Webpack and you have no other option but to include it as a `<script>` tag.
