# ðŸ¥‡ Hepic App

> Hepic app is made with â™¡ by de jaune et de bleu

App available on Netlify - https://hepic-app.netlify.com/

## Informations

This app is created by using [VueJS](https://vuejs.org/) in order to build user interfaces and makes a big use of VueJS dependencies library as [Vue-router](https://router.vuejs.org/) that controls every routing management or [VueX](https://vuex.vuejs.org/) that is a pattern for state management.

Furthermore, Hepic app is generated by [Webpack](https://webpack.js.org/) as asset pipeline. This bundle manager is a modified version of the one generated by [VueCli](https://cli.vuejs.org/).
Webpack is setup to use [LESS](http://lesscss.org/) for CSS and [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) for JavaScript compiling/transpiling and [Pug - Jade](https://pugjs.org/api/getting-started.html) for templating generation.

### development
#### Frameworks & preprocessors
This project is written using frammeworks and libraries and various preprocessors for HTML, JS and CSS

* VueJS (js ES6 -> VueX / VueRouter / Axios)
* Axios (RESTfull APIs)
* Colcade library (grid style)
* LESS (Atomic CSS - BEM style)
* PUG/Jade (Web Components OOP)

#### Tools
This project requires some Tools

* Webpack (assets management)
* Babel (transpiling)
* EsLint (js correction -> airBnB rules)
* PostCSS (not directly used here)
* Jest (Unit Test)
* Nightwatch (Automated testing)
* Git (Github Flow -> Netlify CI connection)
* Slack (deployment notification)

## Assets management

### Src > assets folder

This folder is the basic one that you should use by default for your assets. Webpack process all assets in order to improve app performance:

* small images are converted to data URL in base64 to  avoid extra network requests.
* result filenames include hashes, in this way we will have the same URL as long as the content is the same. So you donâ€™t need to worry about browser caching their old versions.

### Root folder

All assets localised in `root` folder will be copied at the root of the `dist` folder. It's a usefull system to manage asset that are required for environement and should avoid be processed by Webpack. It's a modification from VueCLi boilerplate. Hepic may use it for Netlify redir as exemple.

### Static folder

Static folder manage all asset that will not be processed by Webpack and require an absolute URL: useful for these situations:

* You need a file with a specific name in the build output.
* You have thousands of images and need to dynamically reference their paths.
* Some library may be incompatible with Webpack and you have no other option but to include it as a `<script>` tag.

## Store

Hepic app store management is made by following one rule: **all that need to be share between two components (excepts for direct linking from a child) needs to be coded inside the store**. This allows us to ensure the constent reliability on data across all components and let us create a two way binding simulation.

Here, the store is built thanks to VueX store modules.

## Build Setup

The Hepic project is served by Yarn package manager.

``` bash
# install dependencies
yarn install

# serve with hot reload at localhost:8080
yarn run serve

# build for production with minification
yarn run build

# build for production and view the bundle analyzer report
yarn run lint

# run unit tests
yarn run test:unit

# run e2e tests
yarn run test:e2e

```
